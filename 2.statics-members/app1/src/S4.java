/*compound assignment  is possiblefor static variables at the class context.
while declaring the variable we cant use unary operator
you cant intialize the static variable with the variable before it gets intialize you will get 'self-reference' in initializer error
you cannot intialize the variable with the same variable at the time of initialization
